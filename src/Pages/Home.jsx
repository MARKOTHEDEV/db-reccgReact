                  At HOHP our prayer for you is that the God of all grace
                  anoints you with fresh oil and His precious Spirit illuminates
                  the Word as you read. May He empower you to effectively
                  communicate to others the vibrant hope that He has given you
                  to persevere the struggles that you have overcome and continue
                  to overcome. Furthermore, my wife and I pray that your home is
                  a reflection of the joy and peace that God has promised to all
                  of His children who follow Him.
